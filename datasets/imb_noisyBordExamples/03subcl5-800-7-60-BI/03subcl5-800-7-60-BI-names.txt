Minority Class with Rectangular Shape (examples = 800, disturbance ratio = 60%, IR = 7) data set

1: Description.

This is an artificial data set with 2 classes (the minority and the majority class) and 800 examples randomly and uniformly distributed in the two-dimensional space (both attributes were real-valued). The examples from the minority class are located inside rectangles following related works on small disjuncts. The borders of sub-regions in the minority class are disturbed increasing the ratio of borderline examples from the minority class subregions (the disturbance ratio) in 60%.
