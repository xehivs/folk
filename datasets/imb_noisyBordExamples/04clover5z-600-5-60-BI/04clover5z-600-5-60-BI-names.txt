Minority Class with Shape as Clover (examples = 600, disturbance ratio = 60%, IR = 5) data set

1: Description.

This is an artificial data set with 2 classes (the minority and the majority class) and 600 examples randomly and uniformly distributed in the two-dimensional space (both attributes were real-valued). The minority class resembles a flower with elliptic petals. The borders of sub-regions in the minority class are disturbed increasing the ratio of borderline examples from the minority class subregions (the disturbance ratio) in 60%.
