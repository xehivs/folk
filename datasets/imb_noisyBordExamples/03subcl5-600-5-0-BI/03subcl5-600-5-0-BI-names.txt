Minority Class with Rectangular Shape (examples = 600, IR = 5) data set

1: Description.

This is an artificial data set with 2 classes (the minority and the majority class) and 600 examples randomly and uniformly distributed in the two-dimensional space (both attributes were real-valued). The examples from the minority class are located inside rectangles following related works on small disjuncts.
